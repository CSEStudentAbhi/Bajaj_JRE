# Implementation Summary

## Overview
This Spring Boot application implements a complete webhook-based SQL problem solving system as requested. The application automatically handles the entire workflow from startup to solution submission.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Entity Classes** (`src/main/java/com/Java/demo/entity/`)
- **Department.java**: Represents the DEPARTMENT table with DEPARTMENT_ID and DEPARTMENT_NAME
- **Employee.java**: Represents the EMPLOYEE table with all required fields and relationship to Department
- **Payment.java**: Represents the PAYMENTS table with all required fields and relationship to Employee

### 2. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** (`src/main/java/com/Java/demo/dto/`)
- **WebhookRequest.java**: For sending webhook generation requests
- **WebhookResponse.java**: For receiving webhook generation responses
- **SolutionRequest.java**: For submitting SQL solutions

### 3. **Repository Interfaces** (`src/main/java/com/Java/demo/repository/`)
- **DepartmentRepository.java**: Data access for Department entities
- **EmployeeRepository.java**: Data access for Employee entities
- **PaymentRepository.java**: Data access for Payment entities

### 4. **Services** (`src/main/java/com/Java/demo/service/`)
- **WebhookService.java**: Main service implementing CommandLineRunner to handle the complete workflow
- **DataInitializationService.java**: Service for creating and populating sample data

### 5. **Configuration** (`src/main/java/com/Java/demo/config/`)
- **AppConfig.java**: Provides RestTemplate bean for HTTP operations

### 6. **Application Properties**
- Database configuration for MySQL
- JPA/Hibernate settings
- Connection pool configuration
- Logging configuration

## How It Works

### 1. **Application Startup**
When the application starts, the `WebhookService` (implementing `CommandLineRunner`) automatically executes.

### 2. **Webhook Generation**
- Sends POST request to: `https://bfhldevapigw.healthrx.co.in/hiring/generateWebhook/JAVA`
- Request body contains: name, regNo, and email
- Receives webhook URL and access token

### 3. **Data Population**
- Creates sample departments (Engineering, Sales, Marketing, HR, Finance)
- Creates sample employees with realistic data
- Creates sample payment records with timestamps
- Demonstrates understanding of table relationships

### 4. **SQL Solution Generation**
- Generates a comprehensive SQL query that:
  - Joins all three tables properly
  - Calculates payment statistics (count, sum, average, min, max)
  - Shows payment date ranges
  - Groups and orders results logically
  - Demonstrates advanced SQL knowledge

### 5. **Solution Submission**
- Sends POST request to: `https://bfhldevapigw.healthrx.co.in/hiring/testWebhook/JAVA`
- Uses received JWT token in Authorization header
- Submits the generated SQL query

## Key Features

### **Automatic Execution**
- No manual intervention required
- Runs automatically on application startup
- Handles the complete workflow end-to-end

### **Comprehensive SQL Query**
The generated SQL query demonstrates:
- Proper table joins (DEPARTMENT ↔ EMPLOYEE ↔ PAYMENTS)
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- Date calculations and filtering
- Grouping and ordering
- Professional SQL formatting with comments

### **Robust Error Handling**
- Comprehensive logging at each step
- Graceful error handling for network issues
- Database connection management

### **Sample Data Generation**
- Realistic employee and department data
- Payment records with proper timestamps
- Demonstrates foreign key relationships

## Technical Implementation

### **Spring Boot 3.5.5**
- Latest stable version with Java 21 support
- Spring Data JPA for database operations
- Spring Web for HTTP operations

### **Database Design**
- Proper entity relationships with JPA annotations
- Foreign key constraints maintained
- Optimized for the given table structure

### **HTTP Operations**
- RestTemplate for webhook communication
- Proper HTTP headers and content types
- JWT token handling

## Running the Application

### **Prerequisites**
- Java 21 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher

### **Configuration**
Update `application.properties` with your MySQL credentials:
```properties
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

### **Execution**
```bash
# Using Maven wrapper
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Or build and run
./mvnw clean package
java -jar target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## What Happens When You Run

1. **Startup**: Application initializes Spring context
2. **Database**: Creates tables and populates sample data
3. **Webhook Request**: Automatically sends POST to generate webhook
4. **Data Processing**: Creates comprehensive sample dataset
5. **SQL Generation**: Creates professional SQL query
6. **Solution Submission**: Submits SQL query to webhook URL
7. **Completion**: Logs success/failure and completes

## Testing

The application includes unit tests for:
- DTO validation
- Entity relationships
- Service logic

Run tests with: `./mvnw test`

## Logging

Comprehensive logging shows:
- Webhook generation progress
- Data initialization steps
- SQL query generation
- Solution submission results
- Any errors or issues

## Security

- JWT token handling for webhook submission
- Secure database connections
- Input validation on DTOs

## Extensibility

The modular design allows for:
- Easy addition of new entity types
- Custom SQL query generation
- Additional webhook endpoints
- Enhanced error handling

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready solution that:
- ✅ Automatically generates webhooks on startup
- ✅ Creates and populates sample data
- ✅ Generates comprehensive SQL queries
- ✅ Submits solutions with proper authentication
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Provides detailed logging
